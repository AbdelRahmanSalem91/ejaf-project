        The workforce dislike amendments. The staff is devoted to their work
        with tasks assigned daily which leads to obstruction of the ERP
        solutionâ€™s chances of adoption. An optimum way to deal with this
        resistance is that the organizations should train the staff with
        reference to the new ERP, thus allowing them to work freely in an
        innovative atmosphere with ERP training.
