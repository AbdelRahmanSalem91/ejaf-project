            Acquiring a bit of information about network activity and keeping up
            to date about firewall logs can be a difficult and tiring job
            because the security tool usually generates a huge amount of logs.
            To solve this problem, we have introduced a tool known as Firewall
            Analyzer. It is software that generates less but important logs that
            help the executives to get information about bandwidth usage.
            Moreover, it is a seller rationalist and is compatible with all
            commercialized network firewalls consisting of Check Point, Cisco,
            Juniper, Fortinet, Palo alto, and many more.
