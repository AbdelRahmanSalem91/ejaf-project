          <p class="desc">
            Wan Optimization allows you to analyze the performance of a network
            and the application, along with detection of the end-user
            experience.
          </p>
          <p class="desc">
            IT has the capacity to troubleshoot and deal with issues by
            combining application, network and end-user efficacy for deep
            visibility. You can improve the dexterity of your business by using
            a complete package of network services and business-oriented,
            purpose-based international strategies with regional applicability.

          <p class="desc">
            A WAN accelerator uses data compression and caching processes to
            decrease the quantity of data streaming across WAN. A WAN
            accelerator, instead of sending files across WAN, again and again,
            works by caching the copied files and storing them in universal
            caches. WAN accelerator is of particular significance in cases where
            the bandwidth is the primary restriction by effectively exchanging
            the network I/O for the disc I/O, thereby increasing the efficacy of
            data transfer across the network.

            Traffic shaping means the maintenance of the rate of data transfer.
            Traffic shaping helps to curtail the overcrowding until the server
            sends a limited amount of data. This limited amount of data is
            extremely important during the transfer of real-time data files like
            audio, video, etc.

            If we lessen the number of bits required to embody the data then it
            is said that we have compressed the data. Data compression can be
            very beneficial as it takes less storage capacity. Moreover, a file
            can be easily transported if it contains compressed data. It also
            proves to be budget-friendly as it decreases the expenditure for
            storage hardware and network bandwidth.

          <p class="desc">
            There is an incorporated intelligence in Caching servers which saves
            the most previously and repeatedly bidden information. This holds
            importance in the deterrence of future requests from crossing a
            WAN/Internet link unnecessarily. They also possess a timestamp of
            their recent update. The caching server will cite a locally stored
            sample of the web page if the page timestamp fails to rectify when a
            user visits the page. This will conserve time as the need to load
            the page from across the Internet would be eliminated.
