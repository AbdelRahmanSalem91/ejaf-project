        How to define a Network Penetration Testing?
      </h2>
      <p class="desc">
        A network penetration test mainly aims at detecting bugs in networks,
        protocols, host applications, and network appliances (i.e., routers,
        switches), so hackers can discover and manipulate the bugs. A network
        penetration test can provide hackers with real-world chances to
        jeopardize devices and networks and enable unwanted exposure to
        confidential details or control devices for suspicious/non â€“ commercial
        motives.
