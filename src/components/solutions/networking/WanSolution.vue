          <p class="desc">
            A WAN accelerator uses data compression and caching processes to
            decrease the quantity of data streaming across WAN. A WAN
            accelerator, instead of sending files across WAN, again and again,
            works by caching the copied files and storing them in universal
            caches. WAN accelerator is of particular significance in cases where
            the bandwidth is the primary restriction by effectively exchanging
            the network I/O for the disc I/O, thereby increasing the efficacy of
            data transfer across the network.

          <p class="desc">
            Traffic shaping means the maintenance of the rate of data transfer.
            Traffic shaping helps to curtail the overcrowding until the server
            sends a limited amount of data. This limited amount of data is
            extremely important during the transfer of real-time data files like
            audio, video, etc.

          <p class="desc">
            Deduplication, as the name indicated means â€˜removal of duplicates.
            It is a process of screening a device for any duplicate files
            available and deleting them in order to provide more space. This
            space can then, be used for additional data files. Its main purpose
            is to increase capacity and to prevent the requirement of spending
            on additional storage space. This is a measure that should be taken
            to increase work efficiency.

          <p class="desc">
            If we lessen the number of bits required to embody the data then it
            is said that we have compressed the data. Data compression can be
            very beneficial as it takes less storage capacity. Moreover, a file
            can be easily transported if it contains compressed data. It also
            proves to be budget-friendly as it decreases the expenditure for
            storage hardware and network bandwidth.

            Protocol spoofing plays an important role in data communication and

            illustrated by high omission rates and lengthy delays, then we opt
            for the technological factors which confirm to be a productive
            solution.

            There is an incorporated intelligence in Caching servers which saves
            the most previously and repeatedly bidden information. This holds
            importance in the deterrence of future requests from crossing a
            networking/wan/Internet link unnecessarily. They also possess a
            timestamp of their recent update. The caching server will cite a
            locally stored sample of the web page if the page timestamp fails to
            rectify when a user visits the page. This will conserve time as the
            need to load the page from across the Internet would be eliminated.
