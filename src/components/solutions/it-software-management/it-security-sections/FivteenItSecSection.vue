            Web-based and real-time windows offer inspection and storage stuff
            through which data security is increased, information is managed
            effectively and fulfills the needs of compliance.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            By approaching the anomalies recording access patterns, inspecting
            the share, and NTFS permission, it monitors and examines the access
            to all folders and files.
          </p>

          <p>
            The storage capacity is enhanced by separating the old, unused, and
            unnecessary files, acquiring every bit of information about the
            space and the properties of files and folders.
          </p>

            regarding security through Email alerts.
