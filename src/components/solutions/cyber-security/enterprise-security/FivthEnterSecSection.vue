        This cutting edge firewall is used to handle networks and internet
        traffic. It is done by using the specific application. They are also
        used in the detection of application-specific attacks, thereby
        decreasing it. It can be either hardware-based or software-based with
        specific policies and a mixture of protocols and the port that damages
        the seventh layer. Many characteristics are offered by cutting edge
        firewalls, including Stateful investigation, applicationâ€™s
        understanding, knowledge about the user, Intrusion Protection System,
        multi-purpose modes, and capacity to use the latest updates from insight
        resources.
